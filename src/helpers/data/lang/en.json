      "Here at Blue Kitsunebi, we blend our love for foreign languages with IT, offering services in both fields. In both cases, we emphasize providing quality services that meet our clients' expectations.",

      "We offer online courses for Japanese language (taught in Romanian/English) and English language (taught in Japanese). We do everything possible to ensure a unique, distinct experience in exploring these languages, focusing on each student's individual objectives when designing the lessons. We believe that motivation is key when it comes to acquiring new skills such as mastering a foreign language.",

      "Our software development services primarily focus on creating custom presentation websites (like this one) and mobile applications, but our experience doesn't limit us to just these two categories. We have experience with React, Laravel, Flutter, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, and many others, but we are open to any kind of offers even if they are on other technologies than these."

      "Our Japanese language teacher has dedicated a significant portion of his time learning this language and has mastered it at an advanced level. The teaching method is as efficient as possible and is based on his experiences both as a student and as a teacher. Teaching is done at the pace of the student/group of students, with an emphasis on building solid foundations and a deep understanding of the language. Our company also offers English courses to native Japanese speakers and collaborates with Japanese in the IT field, so you can be sure that the level of Japanese of our teacher is more than sufficient to meet your requirements.",

      "The Japanese language is not as difficult as it is believed to be, in fact, we believe it presents more logical elements than most other languages. Whether you're doing it out of passion, or you need it for a certain reason, we can provide exactly the knowledge you need to achieve your goal.",

      "We are eager to meet new lovers of the Japanese language and anime fans to share our passion (≧▽≦)."
